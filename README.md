# MaturaArbeit
**Some basic info**
- **Project name:** Making a physics simulation with a game engine
- **Project description:** This basic simulation I developed is my highschool's Matura (graduation) project.
- **Game engine used:** Godot 3.5.2
# Installation
Downloadable builds of the simulation can be found under [releases](https://github.com/IvoMiricRibeiro/MaturaArbeit/releases). There is a newer 2.0 version that handles collisions more "realistically", and an older Beta version that is more "perfect". The builds are for Windows and Linux. If you have a Mac, tough luck. No downloadable builds for you.

There is also a WebGL release on [itch.io](https://bitro.itch.io/matura-physics-simulation). This release is the 2.0 version of the simulation.
